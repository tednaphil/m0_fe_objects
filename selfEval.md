# Self-Evaluation

1. WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - Getting to use bits of knowledge that i'd gained from previous mod0 lessons and even using information that I had researched and learned on my own felt very rewarding, especially after a difficult problem.
2. How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - The times that I have set aside to do work seem to be working well for being able to stay focused and complete the tasks on my calendar for each study period.
3. What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - I've learned, and must remember, that a solution does not have to be found on the first attempt and that it's okay to take a break and return to a problem later if you need to. Also, rubber ducking is my friend and I think I will rely on that often through Turing and beyond.
